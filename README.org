** Description
*** Backstory
This project originated from my Computer Science 2 class, where we were tasked to make a Connect Four AI.
I researched about the Minimax decision tree and Alpha-beta pruning.
I spent hours and hours on this project, fine tuning every little aspect that I could at the time.
After submitting the work to my teacher, not only did it beat the AI's he gave for student grading, but it also beat his own Minimax AI 10/10 times.

I posted my code onto my old account and just left it there for several months.

Recently, I decided that I wanted to show my AI to the world.
Since the original code was in Java and there was no "quick and easy" way to run and display the code, I decided to make a website.

*** The Website
The website is a standard Node.js + Express server that serves an HTML file to the user.
The entire game logic is held in the HTML + CSS + JS website.
The server also accepts a POST request of the current board position.
It verifies the validity of the position before sending the board state to the GC Function with the AI.

*** The AI
The AI is written in Java and is deployed as a Google Cloud Function.
It utilizies a Minimax decision tree with alpha beta pruning.
The tree has a maximum depth of 7.

** WIP
Need to fix the mobile site.
Maybe one day.
